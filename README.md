# b4rcms

b4rcms is the cms i am currently using to deploy [my website](https://b4rkod.net.tr), it is currently in design/prototype stage and nothing is concrete soo i won't write the documentation for now. 

It is good enough for the works on my machine :tm: and even then most things aren't automated yet.
This is a test
